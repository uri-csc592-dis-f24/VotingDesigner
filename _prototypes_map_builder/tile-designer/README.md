# STARTER IDEAS

Create a 16x16 tiled grid in Svelte 4.

Each cell in the grid is a separate HTML Canvas element.

The user can click and toggle the color of each cell.

--

Add the ability to click drag to toggle colors.

--

Allow the user to select between colors blue, green, white, and grey.

--

Add a new button that allows me to draw a black lighting bolt inside one cell.

# OTHER START IDEA

Each cell in the grids is a separate HTML Canvas element.

For GridBase, the user can click and toggle the color of each cell.
For GridObjects, the user can click and toggle the letter "O" appearing per cell.
For GridWalking make the border of its cell yellow.
