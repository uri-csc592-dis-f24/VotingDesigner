# STARTER IDEAS

Create a 16x16 tiled grid in Svelte 4.

Each cell in the grid is a separate HTML Canvas element.

The user can click and toggle the color of each cell.

Add the ability to click drag to toggle colors.

Allow the user to select between colors blue, green, white, and grey.

Add a new button that allows me to draw a black lighting bolt inside one cell.
